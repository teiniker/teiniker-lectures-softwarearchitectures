# Software Architectures by Examples

Software Architectures is a huge topic which is mainly discussed in theory. 
This project collects examples for the most common architectural patterns. 
You can find examples for the following software architectural styles:

1. **Layered Architecture**
  * [Data Source Layer](layered/data-source/)
    * Data Access Object (DAO)
  * [Domain Layer](layered/domain/) 
    * Service Layer
    * Dependency Injection
  * [Presentation Layer](layered/presentation/)  
    * Model-View-Controller (incl. Front Controller and View Helper)
    * Remote Facade
    * Data Transfer Object (DTO)
  
2. **Clean Architecture**
  * [Introduction](clean-architecture/README.md)

3. **Microservice Architectures**
  * [API Styles](services/api-styles/) 
    * RPC API
    * Resource API

  * [API Design](services/api-design/)
    * Service Descriptor
    * Web Service Evolution
    * [API Gateway](services/api-gateway/)
